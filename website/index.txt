h2. What

Ruby Apriori is a library to efficiently find item association rules within
large sets of transactions. This library provides a Ruby interface to Christian
Borgelt's C implementation of this algorithm.

From Christian Borgelt's Apriori:http://www.borgelt.net/apriori.html documentation: 

bq. Association rule induction is a powerful method for so-called market basket
    analysis, which aims at finding regularities in the shopping behavior of
    customers.

bq. With the induction of association rules one tries to find sets of
    products that are frequently bought together, so that from the presence of
    certain products in a shopping cart one can infer (with a high probability)
    that certain other products are present. 

bq. An association rule is a rule like "If a customer buys wine and bread, he often
    buys cheese, too."

bq. An association rule states that if we pick a customer at random and find out
    that he selected certain items (bought certain products, chose certain options
    etc.), we can be confident, quantified by a percentage, that he also selected
    certain other items (bought certain other products, chose certain other options
    etc.).

This Ruby library provides a convenient way to use this algorithm from Ruby.

h2. Demonstration of usage

<pre syntax="ruby">
  require 'apriori'

  transactions = [  %w{beer doritos},
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{beer doritos}, 
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{apple cheese}, 
                    %w{apple doritos} ]

  rules = Apriori.find_association_rules(transactions,
                            :min_items => 2,
                            :max_items => 5,
                            :min_support => 1, 
                            :max_support => 100, 
                            :min_confidence => 20)

  puts rules.join("\n")

  # Results: 
  # doritos <- beer (33.3/2, 100.0)
  # beer <- doritos (50.0/3, 66.7)
  # apple <- doritos (50.0/3, 33.3)
  # doritos <- apple (66.7/4, 25.0)
  # apple <- cheese (50.0/3, 100.0)
  # cheese <- apple (66.7/4, 75.0)

  # NOTE:
  # doritos <- beer (33.3/2, 100.0)
  # means: 
  # * beer appears in 33.3% (2 total) of the transactions (the support)
  # * beer implies doritos 100% of the time (the confidence)
